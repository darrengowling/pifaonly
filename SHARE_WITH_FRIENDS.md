# 🎮⚽ Friends of PIFA - Testing Invite!

Hey! I've built a football auction app for our PIFA society and need your help testing it. It's really fun - you bid against friends for real football teams and compete based on their actual performance!

## 🚀 Quick Start (Takes 5 minutes)

- **If someone created:** Click "Join" on their tournament

**3. Once 4+ people joined:** Admin clicks "Start Auction" 

**4. Live bidding:** Bid on teams like "Manchester City" with time limits

**5. Have fun!** Use chat, compete for the best teams
