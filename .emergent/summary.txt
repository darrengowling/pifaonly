The AI engineer successfully transformed a basic MVP into a production-ready fantasy football auction application. Initially, critical bugs like Squad not found during bidding and issues with the frontend Join Tournament button were identified and meticulously resolved through systematic backend and frontend testing. A significant phase involved analyzing an external repository (champs1) to gather UX/functionality improvement ideas, leading to the implementation of a three-phase roadmap: Phase 1 focused on enhanced auction UX and visual status indicators, Phase 2 introduced tournament join codes and detailed team panels, and Phase 3 added multi-tournament support, an achievement system, global leaderboards, and mobile optimization. The application underwent comprehensive end-to-end testing, confirming all features worked. The most recent task involves building a separate, professional marketing website for the app to support scaling into a business.
