# 🏆 Friends of PIFA - Testing Invitation

**Hello PIFA Members!** 

I've built a fantasy football auction app specifically for our society and need your help testing it before we launch it properly for PIFA competitions!

## 🎯 What is Friends of PIFA?

A digital auction platform where PIFA members bid against each other for exclusive ownership of real football teams (Champions League & Europa League). Your teams then earn points based on actual match performance - perfect for our prediction-loving society!

**Scoring System:**
- **1 point** per goal scored
- **3 points** per match won  
- **1 point** per match drawn

## 🚀 Quick Test (15 minutes needed)

**App Link:** https://soccer-league-bid.preview.emergentagent.com

### Setup Phase (2 minutes):
1. **4+ PIFA members** open the app link
2. **One person** creates a tournament 
3. **Others** join the tournament
4. **Creator** starts the auction when everyone's ready

### Live Auction Phase (10 minutes):
- Bid on teams like Manchester City, Liverpool, Real Madrid
- Use the chat to coordinate (or mislead!) 
- Watch the timer - bidding closes at 0:00
- Manage your £500m budget wisely

### Feedback Phase (3 minutes):
- Was it intuitive to use?
- Any bugs or confusing parts?
